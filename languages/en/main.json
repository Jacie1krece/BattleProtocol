  "Trait.Species.IDK.Desc": "The exact species of this character is currently unknown.",
  "Trait.Species.Human": "\\I[82]Human",
  "Trait.Species.Human.Desc": "Humans are great at being the reference point of all other sapient species. That's why they work so well as nature's blank slate, and have no unique features synonymous with their species. Or maybe that lack of unique features is what makes them unique? And, well, they're pretty resilient, taking less damage from DoT.",
  "Trait.Species.Nurikabe": "\\I[222]Nurikabe",
  "Trait.Species.Nurikabe.Desc": "Nurikabe are one of the most peculiar Y≈çkai, as they're pretty rare due to the fact that being a Nurikabe is a recessive trait. The most recognisable part of a Nurikabe is their permanent, true invisibility. However, their clothes are still visible - but, as Nurikabe are masters of illusions, they can hide them when needed. They can also make temporary invisible barriers when needed. In terms of combat, they have noticeably lower Aggro and slightly higher Guard Effect.",
  "Trait.Species.Skyfolk": "\\I[69]Skyfolk",
  "Trait.Species.Skyfolk.Desc": "Skyfolk are human-like species that possess wings and many adaptations to flight, including more aerodynamic, lighter bodies and resistance to cold and low oxygen levels commonly found at high altitudes. Nothing in the sky is a limit for them, and with their wings, they can not only fly, but also glide and remain in a single spot airborne. They're pretty claustrophobic though. With that in mind, in combat, they're more resistant to \\I[65]Ice and \\I[69]Wind damage.",
  "Trait.Species.Catfolk": "\\I[290]Catfolk",
  "Trait.Species.Catfolk.Desc": "Catfolk are one of the modern beastfolk species, being first made by Dr. Aster, with Minami being the first modern Catfolk. Catfolk have a lot of feline elements - the ears, tail, paws, retractable claws, whiskers, and even instincts. They are generally immune to fall damage and are capable of surviving even the most unexpected dangers. Cats have nine lives, after all. In terms of combat, they have good AGI and Evasion, but dislike being Wet, thus taking more \\I[67]Water damage.",
  "Trait.Species.Slime": "\\I[165]Liquid Lifeform",
  "Trait.Species.Slime.Desc": "Liquid lifeforms are incredibly curious beings - aliens that came to this planet, built out of a single cell - while achieving things like sapience, civilisation, and space travel. Their single-celled form means that their body is malleable and liquid - that's where their name comes from. Even if they're mute, they understand speech and language, and even can communicate through text. In terms of combat, they're generally resistant to \\I[67]Water and \\I[76]Physical, and have a bit higher Evasion.",
  "Trait.Species.Android": "\\I[245]Android",
  "Trait.Species.Android.Desc": "Androids are human-made robots that achieved sapience and are considered fully people by law. They're analitical, great at math, and don't have needs beyond recharging, mainetance, and socialisation. These traits make them great at both being employed and doing housework - just remember to treat them like one of your own. In terms of combat, they're weak to \\I[67]Water and \\I[66]Electricity while being resistant to \\I[76]Physical and being better at doing Crits.",

  "Trait.Role.Secondary": "Secondary Role",
  "Trait.Role.Destruction": "\\I[77]Berserker",
  "Trait.Role.Destruction.Desc": "This character specialises in destroying opponents, alongside good survivability - though they can consume large amounts of resources or even their own health.",
  "Trait.Role.Hunt": "\\I[78]Assassin",
  "Trait.Role.Hunt.Desc": "This character specialises in hunting down the biggest threats with their primary focus on single-target abilities.",
  "Trait.Role.Erudition": "\\I[79]Sage",
  "Trait.Role.Erudition.Desc": "This character can easily tear down groups of weaker enemies or boss summons with their erudition and focus on multi-target abilities.",
  "Trait.Role.Harmony": "\\I[80]Supporter",
  "Trait.Role.Harmony.Desc": "This character can harmonise well with other characters, with their focus on providing helpful buffs and support.",
  "Trait.Role.Nihility": "\\I[71]Weakener",
  "Trait.Role.Nihility.Desc": "This character can slowly turn enemies to nil with the plethora of debuffs that they can apply to them.",
  "Trait.Role.Preservation": "\\I[81]Defender",
  "Trait.Role.Preservation.Desc": "This character can deploy protective measures to preserve their allies in a good state.",
  "Trait.Role.Abundance": "\\I[72]Medic",
  "Trait.Role.Abundance.Desc": "This character can use healing to make ally health constantly in an abundant state.",
  "Trait.Element": "Elemental Affinity",
  "Trait.Element.Physical": "\\I[76]Physical",
  "Trait.Element.Physical.Desc": "This character has a \\I[76]Physical affinity. They take 10% less \\I[76]Physical damage and deal 10% more \\I[76]Physical damage.",

  "Trait.Element.Water": "\\I[67]Water",
  "Trait.Element.Water.Desc": "This character has a \\I[67]Water affinity. They take 10% less \\I[67]Water damage and deal 10% more \\I[67]Water damage.",

  "Trait.Talent": "Passive",
  "Trait.Talent.Ember": "\\I[84]Made of Heat",
  "Trait.Talent.Ember.Desc1": "All of Ember's attacks apply Singed on enemies. Her Body Temperature starts at 70¬∞, and can go up to 120¬∞, influencing Ember's damage output, Luck, debuffs, and supportive capabilities.",
