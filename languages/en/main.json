  "Trait.Species.Human.Desc": "Humans are great at being the reference point of all other sapient species. That's why they work so well as nature's blank slate, and have no unique features synonymous with their species. Or maybe that lack of unique features is what makes them unique?",
  "Trait.Species.Heatling": "\\I[64]Heatling",
  "Trait.Species.Heatling.Desc": "From the appearance side, Heatlings are almost identical to humans - however, what appearance won't tell you that easily is just how hot their bodies can get. With a typical natural body temperature of Heatlings ranging from 70 to 90Â°, touching them directly is a bad idea. They're also immune to all sorts of heat, being able to do things like outright walking through magma without any problems. Their extreme heat also lets them be more resistant to cold. Strong emotions - especially anger or fear - can increase a Heatling's body temperature even further, to the point of doubling it. A Heatling can also manipulate their own body temperature to some degree, primarly to make direct contact with them less dangerous or to improve their own combat effectiveness.<br>Stat influences:<br>Immunity to \\I[64]Fire and \\I[141]Floor damage; Strong resistance to \\I[65]Ice damage; Slight resistance to \\I[67]Water and \\I[70]Star damage",

They have the ability to breathe water, and thus mostly live underwater - and they can also control their own buyoyancy. Waterfolk don't typically go on land, but if they do, they can easily manage life there - just minding the fact that their skin is very slippery and will make walking more difficult without footwear.<br>Stat influences:<br>Immunity to \\I[67]Water damage; Slight resistance to \\I[64]Fire, \\I[69]Wind and \\I[141]Floor damage; Slight vulnerability to \\I[65]Ice and \\I[66]Electricial damage",

  "Trait.Species.Foxhuman": "\\I[163]Foxhuman",
  "Trait.Species.Foxhuman.Desc": "Foxhumans's main characteristic traits are their fox-like ears and tail. They have a great alignment with magic, coming second to only Witches.

Catnip also has a strong influcence on most of their species. Cathumans also have a knack of getting away from very dangerous situations unscatched, and don't experience any damage from even the highest falls - making them really adventurous and seemingly fearless.<br>Stat influences:<br>Strong resistance to \\I[2]DoT and \\I[141]Floor damage; Slight resistance to \\I[64]Fire and \\I[66]Electricial damage; Slight vulnerability to \\I[65]Ice damage; Strong vulnerability to \\I[67]Water damage",
  "Trait.Species.Witch": "\\I[133]Witch",
  "Trait.Species.Witch.Desc": "Witches are powerful spellcasters, besting even the Foxhumans in terms of just how much Mana they can handle. Even with that, they're not immune to mishaps; heck, there is even an entire circle of \"Witchfailures\" that's focused on the few witches that accidentally and pernamently altered their bodies, and now try to cope and live with the unusual changes, like invisibility or elasticity. There's an another thing though; while Witches are undoubtedly a \"species\", they're unusually all-female.<br>Stat influences:<br>Strong resistance to \\I[79]Magical and \\I[70]Star damage; Slight resistance to \\I[2]DoT and \\I[76]Physical damage; Strong vulnerability to \\I[71]Void damage",

  "Trait.Species.Alien.Desc": "Aliens... from the limited data avaliable, they appear humanoid, but with many truly unique properties, including very varied skin colours, ability to survive in oxygenless environments, immunity to radiation, and having somewhat squishier, more flexible and extendable bodies, due to their invertebrate nature.

  "Trait.Species.Fairy": "\\I[149]Fairy",
  "Trait.Species.Fairy.Desc": "Fairies, with their wings and small, child-like strature, are great at flying and using magic, being the 3rd best magic users, bested only by Foxhumans and Witches. They are very keen to use that for pranks, however. Even if they appear to be dumb, they are commonly smarter than they look - and can clearly stand up for themselves. Some jokingly even say that Fairies are the strongest species, and there's a bit of truth in this exagerrated statement.<br>Stat influences:<br>Immunity to \\I[141]Floor damage; Strong resistance to \\I[70]Star damage; Slight resistance to \\I[78]Material and \\I[65]Ice damage; Slight vulnerability to \\I[69]Wind damage",
